# ‚öõÔ∏è Quantum Mechanics Notes
A repository where all my QM course notes are stored without a specific order.
All notes are pushed into this repo in Italian because the course was taught in that language and I don't have time to translate hundreds of handwritten pages. 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer and Sources
These notes are my **personal interpretation and reworking** of the lectures given by Prof. Mauro Moretti for the "Elements of Quantum Mechanics" course (Academic Year 2024/2025) @ UniFE Department of Physics. They are also based on the reference textbook and other academic sources. The purpose of this repository is purely educational and for knowledge sharing. All concepts have been reworked and are presented based on my own understanding of the topics.
